# -Detecting-SuicidalIntention-in-TwitterData-A-MachineLearning-Approach

This project analyzes social media content to detect suicidal intentions using Machine Learning and content analysis techniques. By identifying patterns in user expressions, it contributes to the development of strategies to support individuals in distress, aiding in the prevention of suicide and promoting mental health awareness in the digital age.

# Project Overview

Social media platforms often reveal expressions of emotional distress that can signal suicidal intent. This project aims to:

- Identify Suicidal Intentions: Detect potential signs of distress and suicidal ideation through text analysis.
- Support Mental Health Efforts: Provide insights for early intervention and support strategies.
- Leverage Machine Learning: Utilize advanced algorithms to classify text data accurately and efficiently.

The project serves as a stepping stone toward enhancing the understanding of mental health issues in the digital era.

## Files in the Repository

- **`Suicide_Intent_Prediction.ipynb`:**
  - A Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, and model development.

- **`twitter-suicidal_data.xlsx`:**
  - A dataset containing tweets labeled with their corresponding intentions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SMoganaVadhna/-Detecting-SuicidalIntention-in-TwitterData-A-MachineLearning-Approach.git

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Suicide_Intent_Prediction.ipynb

3. **Run the Notebook:**

   - Execute cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Technologies Used
   - Programming Language: Python
   - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, langid

## Result

- Accurate Identification of Suicidal Intent: The model is expected to differentiate between tweets with suicidal intent and other tweets with reasonable accuracy, precision, recall, and accuracy.

- Improved Mental Health Intervention: The results of this project can aid in timely identification of individuals expressing suicidal thoughts, enabling better mental health interventions and support systems.

- Key Insights into Text Patterns: The project may reveal patterns or keywords commonly associated with suicidal intent, offering valuable insights into linguistic markers of distress.

- Performance Benchmarks: The trained model will establish benchmarks such as overall accuracy, confusion matrix analysis, and classification metrics (precision, recall, and accuracy) to assess its effectiveness.
