# -Detecting-SuicidalIntention-in-TwitterData-A-MachineLearning-Approach

This project analyzes social media content to detect suicidal intentions using Machine Learning and content analysis techniques. By identifying patterns in user expressions, it contributes to the development of strategies to support individuals in distress, aiding in the prevention of suicide and promoting mental health awareness in the digital age.

# Project Overview

Social media platforms often reveal expressions of emotional distress that can signal suicidal intent. This project aims to:

- Identify Suicidal Intentions: Detect potential signs of distress and suicidal ideation through text analysis.
- Support Mental Health Efforts: Provide insights for early intervention and support strategies.
- Leverage Machine Learning: Utilize advanced algorithms to classify text data accurately and efficiently.

The project serves as a stepping stone toward enhancing the understanding of mental health issues in the digital era.
